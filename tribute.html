        <h1> Shoes </h1> 
    <p class="first-paragraph"> Shoes protect our feet away from harm, for some, shoes are just things that when it's broken they easily get rid of it and throw into the trash can, but, things go a little different for me. I value things that I've been wearing for years that it becomes part of myself that's hard to let go of, just like these shoes which I'd been wearing since grade 7 that for almost a decade had never failed me to stumble or walk barely for acquiring injuries from my feet or toes. I walk comfortably and I can run smoothly every time I used these, these shoes had been with me with every moment I had since I was a grade 7 student. </p>
    <p class="second-paragraph"> It all started when I was in grade 7, prior to having these, I had one pair of shoes that didn't even last for 3 months. Luckily, my generous cousin gave me these, it's not my typical type but I'm not picky to wear any other shoes, as long as it is school related shoes. I remember I was too afraid to even run with these â€” afraid they might tear off. But, as I wear these a little longer, a year-long, I began to get close to these that I started using these for running, running to save time from being late and it did save me most of the time. It's unbelievable to think that I've grown fond of having these that even performing P.E. activities had to be this pair of shoes that I should wear and I did performed well from running to jumping. This pair of shoes is also with my every: With every, step I had going to school since grade 7, these shoes accompanied me. With every oral recitation I had, these shoes comforted my shaky legs and sweaty feet. And, with every moment that I had with my crushes, these shoes had witnessed it. If I were to choose from any other things to stay with me for life then I would've gotten these until I had my last breath or I will wear these for my burial, but perhaps I couldn't for the holes it had which water can enter and even my hands could fit through ... </p> 
    <p class="third-paragraph"> Shoes are truly commendable when we go on a journey like going to school or seeing something new, a journey which enables us to learn something or gain experience. It is unimaginable to think that I couldn't wear these till many tomorrows, maybe if things go according to plan and I am eligible to graduate for college then I must wear these ... These may be just shoes for someone but for me, these are the pair of shoes that had been part of many journeys I've had. All the words I can say, and I choose THANK YOU. Thank you, my dear sapatos, for being with me for almost 7 years. You will never be forgotten since you'll stay under my bed until I grow old to live.
